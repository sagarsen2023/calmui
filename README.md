# CalmUI

**CalmUI** is a powerful CLI tool for modern frontend development. It guarantees a clean, scalable, and opinionated project structure from day one, streamlining developer workflows and supporting long-term code quality.

### Why??

Ever spent half an hour in a group call debating if it should be `components` or `Components`, `home` or `HomePage`, only to discover three different folder structures by the end of sprint?  

**CalmUI ends the chaos.**  
With project structure, templates, and module files handled for you, you can finally spend less time renaming folders‚Äîand more time shipping code.


## üöÄ Features & Benefits

- **Automated, consistent project structure** for React (Vite, Next.js) and more.
- **Custom scaffolding** for modules/routes‚Äînever worry about file/folder conventions again.
- **Framework-aware**: detects and adapts to Vite, Next.js, etc.
- **Dynamic route generation** supporting nested and parameterized routes.
- **TypeScript-first** setup with zero-config ESM/JS switching.
- **Edge case handling**: guards against accidental overwrites and misconfiguration.
- **Easy extensibility**‚Äîadd your own templates as your needs grow!

## üì¶ Installation

Install CalmUI globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g calmui
```

_(Or use `npx calmui ...` for one-off commands without installation.)_

## üõ† Project Initialization

Create a new project in a **specific folder**:

```bash
calmui init my-project
```

Or initialize a project in the **current directory** (checks if folder is empty and prompts accordingly):

```bash
calmui init
```

During initialization, you‚Äôll be prompted to select a framework:

- `Vite` (with Tanstack Router + Tailwind by default)
- `Next.js` (with Tailwind)
- _(React Native‚Äîcoming soon)_

A local `calmui.json` will be created to store scaffolding config.

## ‚ú® Route/Module Generation

CalmUI lets you add new routes or modules with a single command, keeping your folder structure consistent.

**Generate a basic route:**

```bash
calmui generate-route /my-route
```

After executing the command you'll see that folder specific files are created.

**Generate a dynamic route:**

```bash
calmui generate-route /my-route/:id
```

**Advanced routes/nesting examples:**

```bash
calmui generate-route /my-route/:id/edit
calmui generate-route /product-details/:slug
calmui generate-route /users/accounts/orders/:id/:status/update
```

- Generates boilerplate, folder structure, and pre-wired modules for each part of the route.
- Works seamlessly for both Vite and Next.js projects.

## üß© Other Commands (Coming Soon)

- Route migration

## üìù Recommended Project Workflow

1. Install CalmUI globally (or use `npx`).
2. Run `calmui init` to start a new project‚Äîpick your stack with the arrow keys.
3. Use `calmui generate-route` as needed to build out your app‚Äîno more worrying about folder or page naming.
4. Let CalmUI handle your scaffolds, configs, and structure‚Äîfocus on real features.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q:** Do I need to use TypeScript?  
**A:** TypeScript is the default, but CalmUI supports ESM JS output if required.

**Q:** Can I use CalmUI in an existing (non-empty) folder?  
**A:** Yes, but you‚Äôll be prompted to confirm or clean up the folder first.
